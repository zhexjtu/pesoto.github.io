Welcome! My name is Zhe Wang and I'm pursuing my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at Univeristy of Virginia under the supervision of Professor <a href="http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/zbxu" target="_self">Yanjun Qi</a>. I am interested in machine learning and focus on the machine learning tasks on discrete data, such as bio-data and text. 
<br><br>
My research interests lie in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I am particularly interested in learning theory, optimization, generative model and have a systematic knowledge related to these fields. Feel free to look at my <a href="https://zhexjtu.github.io/research" target="_self">research</a> and my <a href="https://zhexjtu.github.io/tutorials" target="_self">tutorials</a> to known more!
