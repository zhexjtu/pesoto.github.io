I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. degree in computer science under the supervision of Professor Yanjun Qi in University of Virginia. I started my academic career in mathematics, with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics (Elite Class) from Xi'an Jiaotong University. After graduation, I spent some time helping a survey about the social integration assessment of migrant workers in Shaanxi province. Besides school life, I sometimes share my research via my blog about topics in AI and ML on Zhihu(Chinese Quora) and enjoy discussing open problems with follwers. Outside of academic and research, I am also a big fan of high-tech and always willing to try new Apps on phone and laptop. Moreover, I like reading biographies of mathematicians and participating  philosophical symposium held by my friends on vacation.
