I am currently pursuing my Master degree in Applied Mathematics at Xi'an Jiaotong University. I started my academic career in mathematics, with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics (Elite Class) from Xi'an Jiaotong University. After gruduation, I spent some time helping a survey about the social integration assessment of migrant workers in Shaanxi province and it's mt first time to feal the powerful of data and algorithm. Besides school life, I sometimes sharing my research via my blog about topics in AI and ML on Zhihu(Chinese Quora) and enjoy discussing open problems with follwers. Outside of academic and research, I am also a big fan of high-tech and always willing to try new Apps on phone and laptop. Moreover, I like reading biographies of mathematicians and participating  philosophical symposium held by my friends on vacation. I'm learning cooking right now and it seems much more difficult than study!
